In this project an A* search algorithm was implemented to find paths in the platformer game Ultimate Chicken Horse.

## Getting Started

The DataAnalysis folder contains python code that was used to analyze and model the behavior of the game's mechanics. 
Further, all gathered datasets and plots can be found there also.

In the UCHBot folder are several mods that have been implemented to interact with the game. This solution does not compile in the current state as the decompiled Assembly-CSharp.dll is not checked in to the repository. To be able to run the solution a decompiled version of the Assembly-CSharp.dll of the game is needed. The decompiled dll can be obtained by using IlSpy.

The game itself must be located in the repository folder in a folder called "UltimateChickenHorse". The game can be obtained on Steam.
